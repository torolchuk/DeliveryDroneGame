### About:

This game is about undelivering. What is undelivered, you may ask? It’s like stealing, but not exactly.

Your company has successful business in taking things people don’t need anymore. But OMG, your car has a gas tank and it will not refill itself. So, for success you should:

Take packages that is marked in your delivery order list (Bottom left of your screen)

Take fuel tanks to ensure your car can go another few miles (bottom right of your screen)

Increase your combo multiplier by delivering first item from your delivery list (combo multiplier is displayed aside your score)

### Controls:

To move your drone use [WASD] keys. To pickup and release items use [SPACE] key. To navigate in the menus use your mouse.

My m2 max Macbook has issues with webgl, but it works fine on windows. If you have issues with it and you are a Mac use, feel free to download .app

It’s my first game ever and my first Ludum Dare and it was awesome.​

By the way, I and my team (my girlfriend <3) are from Ukraine and currently we are fighting agains Russia. Please, support us as much as you can. We fight not only for our freedom, but for freedom of the Europe and for the better future of the world.
